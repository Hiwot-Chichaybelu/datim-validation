# datim-validation
Datim validation scripts

To get started, be sure you have installed the `devtools` package with 
```R
install.packages('devtools')
```

Once you have installed that, you can proceed to try and load the `datim-validation` package with

```R
library(devtools)
install_github("jason-p-pickering/datim-validation")
```

If you prefer, you can download the source of the package with the vignettes and build these as well (reccomended for new users).
```R
devtools::install_github('jason-p-pickering/datim-validation',build_vignettes = TRUE)
```


Once the package has installed, you can load it with the following command:

```R
library(datimvalidation)
```

Consult the vignette in the package documentation on how to use the library.
